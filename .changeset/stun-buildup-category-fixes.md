Fix Stun Buildup stat mapping and Two Hand weapon category selection

- Fix "Causes X% increased Stun Buildup" incorrectly mapping to generic stun buildup filter
- Add fallback system for Two Hand weapon categories (try "Two-Handed Mace" then "Two Hand Mace")
- Implement unsupported flag for intentionally excluded stats
