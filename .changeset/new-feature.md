Add checkbox state persistence and scale display fixes

**New Features:**
- Checkbox states are now preserved when interface is minimized and reopened after search
- Scale value display now appears correctly when expanding from FAB at non-100% scale
- Fixed 'Adds # to #' stat filters to populate min column instead of max column

**Improvements:**
- Enhanced user experience with persistent checkbox selections
- Improved scale value handling across interface sessions
- Better stat filter accuracy for damage range modifiers

This resolves user-reported issues with checkbox state handling and improves the overall user experience with persistent settings.
