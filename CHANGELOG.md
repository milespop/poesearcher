## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 59338d0: Add intelligent stat combination for pseudo totals in search filters

  Implements automatic combination of implicit + explicit stats into pseudo totals for more accurate searches:

  **Core Feature:**

  - Combines matching implicit and explicit stats during search filter creation only
  - Item preview continues to show individual stats unchanged
  - Example: `+28% to Lightning Resistance (implicit)` + `+36% to Lightning Resistance` â†’ `+64% total to Lightning Resistance`

  **Supported Stat Categories:**

  - **Elemental Resistances**: Fire, Cold, Lightning, Chaos
  - **Core Attributes**: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, All Attributes
  - **Energy Shield**: Maximum Energy Shield and Energy Shield from Body Armour
  - **Critical Stats**: Critical Hit Chance and Critical Damage Bonus

  **Technical Implementation:**

  - Added `combineCompatibleStats` function with intelligent pattern matching
  - Regex-based stat parsing with flexible whitespace and optional + prefix handling
  - Preserves original stats in item display while using combined totals for search accuracy
  - Comprehensive integration testing to ensure reliability

  This addresses a major usability gap where users had to manually calculate total resistance/attribute values when searching for items with both implicit and explicit modifiers. The feature seamlessly integrates with existing pseudo stat mappings to provide more accurate and user-friendly search filtering.

- 3158960: Add support for Area of Effect stat modifiers

  - Add `#% increased Area of Effect` stat mapping for generic area of effect scaling
  - Add `#% increased Area of Effect for Attacks per 10 Intelligence` stat mapping for intelligence-scaling AoE
  - Add `#% increased Area of Effect of Curses` stat mapping for curse-specific area effects

- 3158960: Add support for Table 11: MINION STATS

  Implements comprehensive minion stat mappings including:

  **High Priority Stats:**

  - `Minions deal #% increased Damage` - Core minion damage scaling
  - `Minions have #% increased maximum Life` - Essential minion survivability
  - `Minions have #% increased Attack and Cast Speed` - Critical minion speed scaling
  - `Minions have #% to all Elemental Resistances` - Core minion defense

  **Medium Priority Stats:**

  - `Minions have #% additional Physical Damage Reduction` - Physical damage mitigation
  - `Minions have #% increased Critical Damage Bonus` - Minion critical strike scaling
  - `Minions have #% increased Critical Hit Chance` - Minion critical chance
  - `#% increased Minion Accuracy Rating` - Minion hit chance
  - `Minions have #% to Chaos Resistance` - Chaos damage protection

  **Advanced Stats:**

  - `Minions gain #% of their maximum Life as Extra maximum Energy Shield` - Hybrid minion defense
  - `Minions Revive #% faster` - Minion revival speed

  This addresses a major gap in minion build support, bringing minion stat coverage from 0% to comprehensive coverage of all essential minion modifiers. All 11 new stat mappings include proper regex patterns with support for optional + prefixes and flexible whitespace handling.
